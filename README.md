# Image Coloring Using U-Net
This is a modification on the U-Net architeture to color greyscale images. A L1 Loss function is used here. The dataset used can be found at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theblackmamba31/landscape-image-colorization](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theblackmamba31/landscape-image-colorization). The U-Net architecture used is directly referenced from the original paper: [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical
Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf). The diagram of the architecture is as follows:
